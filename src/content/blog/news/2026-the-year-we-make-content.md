New year, new me, new something or other...

2026 might finally be the year I get a little more consistent with writing blog posts, just to test myself and sharpen those writing skills.

It has also been an opportunity to review the site's codebase and dust off a few cobwebs and fix some of the nagging issues I had with it.

Not much else to say except let's see if I can keep finding interesting topics to write about. You might also see more pictures of my cats.

_Some might recognise title of this post is an indulgent and pointless allusion to the film [2010: The Year We Make Contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010:_The_Year_We_Make_Contact), which is good, but not a patch on [2001: A Space Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey). You will find many such random references in my posts though._
