I have redesigned my website using React and Astro.

If you're a developer and you are interested in how the work is done, here are some details. The site is not open source but please feel free to get in touch at [antony@antonyholmes.com](mailto:antony@antonyholmes.com) if you would like to view the code base.

The site is primarily developed using Astro, a framework for building static websites with optional reactivity through multiple different frameworks.

Most of the site that you see is static, rendered at build time and served as plain HTML for speed, SEO and accessibility. I used Tailwind to style components.
