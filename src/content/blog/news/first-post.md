Welcome to my site, a glorious temple to all things me, or not, we shall see. It's primarily developed for my own amustment.

Take a look around and see if you can find something useful. I hope to post about finance and tech, which are my areas of interest and hopefully yours too.

Most of the site is static, rendered at build time and served as plain HTML for speed, SEO and accessibility. For this, I use [Astro](https://astro.build/) along with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style components. The interactive portions use [React](https://react.dev/).

The site is currently not open source, but maybe soon, but please feel free to get in touch at [antony@antonyholmes.dev](mailto:antony@antonyholmes.dev) if you would like to view the code base.

_Now I've actually got to write stuff..._
