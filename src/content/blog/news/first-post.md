Welcome to my site. Take a look around and see if you can find something useful.

<!-- more -->

The site is primarily developed for my own enjoyment using Astro, a framework for building static websites with optional reactivity through multiple different frameworks.

Most of the site that you see is static, rendered at build time and served as plain HTML for speed, SEO and accessibility. I used Tailwind to style components. The interactive portions use React.

The site is currently not open source but please feel free to get in touch at [antony@antonyholmes.dev](mailto:antony@antonyholmes.dev) if you would like to view the code base.
