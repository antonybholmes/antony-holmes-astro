New Yorkers are collectively mourning the death of dollar pizza with most slice joints having increased their prices by at least 50% so a slice is now an eye-watering $1.50.

Personally I've never thought it tasted that great. They have to make quite a few concessions to get it that cheap. The sauce is often more sweet and ketchup-y than it should be and the cheese is lacking in both taste and consistency. Still, it has legions of fans and offers a quick, cheap, on the go meal with a basically unbeatable price, especially in New York.

My advice, especially if you are not familar with New York pizza, is to just pay an extra couple of bucks and get a better slice. It's still going to be a pretty cheap eat.

I will, however, concede that there was a New York like romance to walking around the East Village in summer and getting a slice at 2 Bros Pizza just as the sun set and the day rolled into one of those warm, fuzzy twilights where the streets seem to come alive with a certain revelry and energy. But that seems to be an era tinted with nostalgia lost in a past that is slowly fading from memory...

_Have you ever had dollar pizza? Did you like it?_
