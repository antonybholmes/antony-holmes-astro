New Yorkers are collectively mourning the death of dollar pizza as most places have increased their prices by 50%. Personally I've never thought it tasted that great, they have to make quite a few concessions to get it that cheap. Just pay an extra couple of bucks to get a better slice.

_Have you ever had dollar pizza? Did you like it?_
