Once you've got your 401k and IRA chugging along nicely, the next type of investment account you can think about is an Health Savings Account (HSA). Some people consider them their favorite investing account due to their triple tax-free tax treatment: you get a deduction for the contribution, it grows tax-free way like a retirement account, and it comes out tax-free if you spend the money on healthcare. At age 65, withdrawals can be made penalty-free (but not tax-free) and spent on anything so it becomes like 401(k) or regular IRA, hence why HSA earned the nickname "The Stealth IRA".

Let's look at what a HSA is and how to use it.

## HDHPs and HSAs

Some people confuse HSAs with High Deductible Health Plans (HDHP). They are not the same thing, but they are related. An HSA is purely an investing account. An HDHP is an insurance policy. You are allowed to contribute to an HSA only if your health insurance policy is an HDHP. So you can have a HDHP without an HSA, but you cannot contribute to an HSA without a HDHP. If you have a HSA, but then change to a non HDHP policy for a given year, you don't have to close the HSA, you just cannot contribute to it, but you can of course still spend existing money from it.

Whether an HDHP is right for you and requires that you run the numbers for what is available to you from your employer or on the open market in your area. In my case, the total out of pocket expenses are about the same for my HDHP and non-HDHP plan, I just have to pay more upfront with the HDHP plan, so I opted for that since I can invest the money that would otherwise go towards a monthly premium. Once you add in the tax benefits of a fully funded HSA, an HDHP can be a better option even for someone who hits their max out-of-pocket payment every year.

## HSAs Can Be Invested

You are not stuck leaving your HSA dollars in a low-interest-rate savings account. You can invest HSA dollars into mutual funds, just like your 401(k). You may want to leave some of the dollars in cash or your HSA plan may require you to do so (if your HSA is through Optum Bank, for example, they will typically require a minimum), but everything above and beyond a certain amount can be invested. Any amount left in your HSA at the end of the year just stays in there for future use.

## HSAs Can Be Transferred

Many people fund their HSA via payroll deduction. This saves some payroll taxes, and it may also facilitate an employer match. But you don't HAVE to fund an HSA this way. We simply do a transfer from our bank into our chosen HSA (Fidelity) the first week of January every year. You also don't have to leave the money in your employer's selected HSA. You can roll it over to someplace with lower fees and better investing options. Technically, you can only do a “rollover” (where you take possession of the money in between custodians) once a year, but you can do as many HSA-to-HSA direct transfers a year as you want. You could even do one after every paycheck, but that seems like a pretty major hassle.

## HSAs Can Be Used with No HDHP

To contribute to an HSA, it is required that your only health insurance plan be an HDHP. However, that is NOT required to spend your HSA dollars. You can use them after changing to another healthcare plan. You can use them for someone who is not even covered by your health insurance plan as long as they are one of the following people:

- You
- Your spouse
- A dependent you can claim on your taxes (including adult children, parents, and more)
- Anyone you could have claimed had they not filed a joint tax return
  While health insurance premiums aren't usually an eligible HSA expense, there are some exceptions you should know about:

COBRA premiums
Premiums paid while unemployed
Medicare premiums
Health insurance once you are retired and over 65 including employer sponsored coverage, ACA/marketplace coverage, dental/vision but not Medicare Supplement Plan Policies
Long-term care insurance premiums
While many of those won't apply to most of us, Medicare premiums are a great way to “finish off” your HSA.

## You Don't Have to Take Withdrawals in the Same Year as the Expense

Some people, including us, have used a “saved receipts” strategy, where you pay for healthcare expenses with current cash flow and digitize the receipts for later tax-free HSA withdrawals. You can spend $8,000 from your checking account getting put back together after falling off a mountain in 2024 and pull $8,000 out of your HSA tax-free in 2034. If the IRS audits you, you just show them your receipt. Remember that the ink and paper most receipts are printed on doesn't last long, though. Digitize those suckers if you do this strategy. Should you use this strategy? I'm leaning away from it these days. But you can. Certainly, it is a reasonable way to use an HSA.

## HSAs Are Best Spent on Healthcare

Lots of people get super excited about their newfound stealth IRA. However, it still makes sense to spend your HSA dollars on healthcare at some point during your life. The higher your tax bracket, the more it makes sense to use those HSA dollars for healthcare, even if you're spending them as you go along rather than saving receipts. In fact, the hassle factor might argue that this is the best way to use your HSA. If you're like most, there will still be extra to invest most years.

<!-- ## HSAs Are Best Left to Charity

While your heirs will still be grateful if they inherit an HSA, they'd all rather inherit something else of equal value. An HSA is actually the worst possible account to inherit. Once you die, it is no longer an HSA, at least for anyone that isn't your spouse. Your non-spousal heir can't spend it tax-free on healthcare, and it does not get a step up in basis at death like a taxable account. It can't be stretched for a decade like an IRA or Roth IRA. It can't be rolled into anything else like a 401(k) or other employer-provided retirement plan. It is just 100% taxable income at ordinary income tax rates to your heir in the year of your death. Not awesome.

However, if you have charitable desires, an HSA is a GREAT account to leave to charity. You don't pay income taxes on it, your estate doesn't pay estate taxes on it, your heirs don't pay income or inheritance taxes on it, and your favorite charity doesn't pay any taxes on it. Our HSA is almost surely overfunded already, but that's OK because we plan to leave a lot to charity at our death. -->

## New Jersey and California Are Not Fans of HSAs

If you are in New Jersey or California, you will discover that your state tax agency treats an HSA as a taxable account. So while you will still get federal income tax protected growth in the HSA, you will not get state income tax protected growth.

HSAs are a pretty cool niche investment account. Learn the rules so you can maximize the benefits.
