Since 1994, New York City has been using MetroCard as its payment system for subways, buses, and cable cars around the city. At the start of 2026 it retired this system in favor of OMNY, a contactless digital system very similar to Oyster that is used in London.

Predictably on Reddit and other forums there has been a bizarre pushback from people who don't seem to want to change to the new system and decry it before even really trying it. I might understand their reluctance to change were it not for a desire to continue with a grossly antiqued system that is largely unfit for purpose and firmly rooted in the limited technology of the 1990s from when it was created.

MetroCard was essentially out-of-date less than 10 years after it was launched with the Oyster starting in 2003 and demonstrating that a tap to enter system could work effectively on a large transit system. The fact it took more than 30 years for the MTA to adopt this system is lamentable, but at least they have do so.

I switched to OMNY 2 years ago when the pilot program rolled out widely enough I could use it daily. I never looked back. Technologically MetroCard was horrible and visually it was hideous with blue 90s WordArt slanted text on a yellow background. People say it was iconic. It was in a way, but only for its ubiquity and longevity. The design always seem amateurish to me; something an intern threw together in PowerPoint over an afternoon.

The naysayers kick up a stink about it somehow being worse, but the a digital system is way more convenient than the flimsy laminated swipe card it leaves behind:

- Able to check balance at home without having to go a station to find a MetroCard reader.
- Don't have to find a MetroCard machine to refill card (these were frequently out of service).
- Can immediately cancel lost card and transfer balance to a new one; no-more having to file claims with the MTA.
- Can connect multiple payment cards.
- If you share transit benefits with your spouse/partner, easy to register transit debit card with two OMNY cards so no more having to share a debit card.

Amongst the grumblings about MetroCard being better, the only legitimate point I can see people having is that OMNY lacks a monthly unlimited option, but that is not unique to MetroCard and could be implemented in OMNY. OMNY somewhat mitigates this by applying a weekly cap to travel costs so in a typical 30 day period, the cost of travel is comparable to what a commuter typically spends on an unlimited card. Yes, a 30 day card is a little cheaper, but the cost saving over a year is unlikely to make a significant difference to someone's life. The elephant in the room is the cost of a subway fare to begin with, now at $3 per ride, so fixating on a 30 limited option seems slightly myopic.

So, farewell MetroCard, you were better than tokens and you filled a void until a better system came along, but like a delicious slice of pizza that has been sitting in the fridge for slightly too long, it's time to go.

_Do you use OMNY? What do you like/dislike about it?_
