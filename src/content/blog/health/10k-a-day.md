I used to enjoy running, but my hips and knees had differing opinions. After much consultation we all amicably decided on doing the next best activity: walking. During the pandemic I became curious to see if I could walk 10,000 steps a day whilst working a fairly long hours job.

I didn't fancy exercising late into the night very much, so to get my steps in, I split my walking time into two main sessions, one at lunch and one after work.

The first order of business, where to walk? Where I work is close to a park, so my lunch hour is spent on a neighbourhood walk to clear my mind for the afternoon's tasks. That solved half my problem. I commute on the subway, but I reasoned that I live reasonably close enough from where I work that I could walk. So I switched and solved the second half. I quit my evening commute in favor of walking home. Both changes had a number of positive benefits:

- More delightful. I deliberately route my walk through a park because it is relaxing to walk through trees and flowers each night, especially during the warmer months when everything is in full bloom.
- Saves money. I quite literally halved my commuting costs.
- Less stressful. Owing to the frequent delays and slow service of the subway, I am much less stressed walking, since I am in control of my pace and where I am going. I'm not stuck in a tunnel for no apparent reason breathing dank air.
- Time saving? It takes me around 40 minutes or so to walk home, since I use a deliberately circuitous route, but even so with transit delays and service interruptions, which seem more prevalent at night, I can often beat the subway by walking, thus making me question.
- Lose weight. Rather obviously more exercise usually helps lower one's weight.

So far, I've stuck with the regime for the past 5 years and I walk around 1,000 miles a year. I'm glad I made the switch.

_Do you enjoy walking? Have you tried walking to/from work?_
