Around the pandemic time I started to think about walking more. I used to enjoy running, but my hips and knees disagreed so I decided to settle for the next best thing, walking. I was curious to see if I could walk 10,000 steps a day whilst working fairly long hours in an office job.

Leaving work late, I didn't much fancy exercising late into the night, so I split my steps into two main sessions, one at lunch and one in the evening.

I commute on the subway so my first thought was walking instead of the subway, so I did. Instead of commuting home I walk.

- Try and walk to/from work.
- More delightful. I deliberately route my walk through a park because it is relaxing to walk through trees and flowers each night, especially during the warmer months when everything is in full bloom.
- Saves money. I quite literally halved my commuting costs.
- Less stressful. Owing to the frequent delays and slow service of the subway, I am much less stressed walking, since I am in control of my pace and where I am going. Less sitting stuck in a tunnel for no apparent reason.
- Time saving? It takes me around 40 minutes or so to walk home, since I use a deliberately circuitous route, but even so with transit delays and service interruptions, which seem more prevalent at night time, I can often beat the transit option by walking, thus making me question what the point of paying for the train is.
- Weightloss.
