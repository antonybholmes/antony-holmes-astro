      "Develop a web based modular genomic data analysis suite to support research biologists. This runs on Amazon Web Services and is a React/Typescript web app connected to Golang microservices backed by Postgresql databases.",
      "AWS administrator leading project to move lab to based cloud infrastructure due to the lab transitioning from purely wet biology to a mixed biology and computational group. This reduced storage and data costs by 50% from in house solutions.",
      "Managed the complete redesign of the Institute for Cancer Genetic's web site as a JAMStack application using React and Gatsby in less than 6 months. This modernized and optimized the site to be performant as well as offering a solution tailored to the institute's need. It resulted in a saving of $40,000 by eliminating the reliance on Drupal and an external provider to manage it."
